# Why We created this App
We created this app to practice using React and Redux.

We created UI design with [figma](https://www.figma.com/design/).
We arranged UI design during developing so first image is a little bit different from others. There are two types of background, daytime and nighttime. Also it will be changed depend on the local weather.
